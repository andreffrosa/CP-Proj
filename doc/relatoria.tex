% Some/most Computer Society conferences require the compsoc mode option,
% but others may want the standard conference format.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:

% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may

% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use

% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer

% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:

% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated

% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better

% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}

Nowadays, the parallel paradigm is a matter of great importance, and the demand for more scalable and efficient data processing algorithms has increased.

In the one hand, the amount of data produced every day grows exponentially [meter uma citação], requiring more computational power to process it at the same speeds.

On the other hand, due to single-core processors are reaching the physical limits of improvement through shrinking its components and increasing its clock speed, a revolution happened in the processor's architecture design. Processors evolution switched to have parallel functionalities, such as multiple cores and hardware threads as well as vector operations, that allow the simultaneously execution of processes and parallel manipulation of multiple data \cite{fasiku2014performance}.

For these reasons, it's crucial to take advantage of these features to build algorithms that allow the processing of such huge amounts of data, having good levels of scalability and latency. However, build such algorithms can be a very difficult and complex task, not only because they have to make use of the previous low level parallel primitives,
but also because those primitives can be platform dependent and are highly heterogeneous, e.g., not all the processors provide vector operations and hardware threads and the amount of cores may vary greatly, even within the same manufacture, take Intel as an example - Intel's i7 lineup has chips with only 2 cores up to chips with a whopping 16 cores.

[Falar de que existem padrões paralelos, como tá no livro, para dizer que podem servir como building blocs de algortimos e assim]
\cite{mccool2010structured}

On that account, we designed and implemented a library that contains some of the most well known parallel patterns.

This library provides an easy way to build parallel programs as well as to update already-built sequential programs to make use of the hardware parallel functionalities, allowing the application-level developer to integrate such patterns and give its application a boost of performance with little effort. We resorted to Intel's Cilk$^+$ \cite{robison2012cilk} to implement those patterns. In order to be able to use it in a vast amount of use cases, these implementations are independent both from the data types they are manipulating and the parallel functionalities provided by each specific hardware platform. We developed each algorithm to try to achieve the maximum possible parallel slack and ... [mudar um bocado isto]

The remaining of this report is structured as follows: at Section~\ref{Architecture} we present the architecture of each pattern, at Section~\ref{Implementation} we discuss the implementation details of our algorithms. The settings of the experiments along with their results are presented in Section~\ref{Experimental_Eval}. Lastly, we conclude this paper with the conclusions, at Section~\ref{Conclusion}.

%We did our best to keep the library independent from the system and the applications.
%So, all of our implementations are independent from data types (all of out functions recieve data as void* ), and independent from the machine's system parallel low-level %intressencts (we make use of Intel's Cilk library to manage and deploy the number of threads needed to excute a given task).

%\par As said before, the parallel paradigm is now a matter of great importance. Every day the amount of data to be
%proce ssed grows, as well as the demand for efficient programs that produce results faster and efficiently.
%Hardware performance has also evolved \textemdash processor architecture has switching from building bigger and
%clockwise faster to have more cores and threads.
%For these reasons, build highly concurrent programs is essential to achieve good levels of scability and letency.
%\par However, code such programs can be very difficult, not only because they make use of low level primitives,
%but also because those primitives can be platform dependent.
%Therefore (outra palavra para nao ser igual?), we builded a library that implements well known parallel patterns
%that allow the application-level developer to integrate such patterns and give its application a
%boost of permormance with little to no difficulty.
%We did our best to keep the library independent from the system and the applications.
%So, all of our implementations are independent from data types and specific concurrent

\section{Architecture} \label{Architecture}

In this Section, we describe the architecture of each of the implement patterns: Map, Reduce, Scan, Pack, Split, Gather, Scatter, Pipeline and Farm. [citações para os patterns]

\subsection{Map}
The map pattern represents the independent application of a function to every element of a collection, and thus each operation can be executed in parallel. This function needs to be pure, e.g., not have side effects in order to be parallelizable. However, the computational weight of the aplication of the function might be too small in comparison to the overhead of parallelizing the tasks, leading to using the sequential version being a better option. Thus, to overcome this problem, the elements can be grouped in batches, that are process in parallel, and, within each batch, the elements are processed sequentially. The size of each batch is called \emph{Grain Size}. [Dizer mais o que?]

\subsection{Reduce}
The reduce pattern represents the application of a pairwise associative operation to all the elements of a collection, producing a single element. Since the operation is associate, multiple applications (to different elements) can be done in parallel. The execution of the parallel version of these pattern produces a binary tree, where the child nodes are the operands and the parent is the result of the operation.

In our library, we implemented two versions of reduce: (regular) reduce and tiled reduce. In regular reduce, the elements of the collection are paired and
the worker (operator) is applied in parallel to each pair. This process is repeated to their results until there is only one element, the reduce result.
However, the weight of the application of the operators may be so small compared to the parallel overhead, that it does not pay to use the parallel version.
Thus, we decided to implement an alternative version for the reduce - tiled reduce, which groups several elements of the collection in a tile, instead of only two, and executes the sequential version for each in parallel.

%Explicar a técnica dos dois arrays para fazer a árvore de execução mas sem a armazenar toda em memória e poupar espaço sem ter apontadores para os pais e filhos, etc.

\subsection{Scan}

The Scan pattern

\subsection{Pack}
The Pack pattern is used to eliminate wasted space in a
sparse collection and to handle variable-rate output from a
map. From within map, each function activation is allowed to
either keep or discard its outputs. The survivors are then
packed together into a single collection.
We consider make our own algorithm to solve pack but because it was not as efficient
as the algorithm proposed by [those dudes] so we opted to implement that algorithm.

\subsection{Split}
The Split\footnote[1]{Optional Extra Pattern} pattern is a variant of pack which does not discard elements, but instead packs them to the top or bottom of the output collection.
In the split pattern, the order of the elements within each output segment is the same as their relative position in the input (in other words, it is a "stable" reordering), and the total output size is always exactly the same size as the input.
Split can obviously be implemented by running pack twice and merging the results. But because this would't be the
most efficient implementation we developed a more direct algorithm to improves latency and thus more time
efficient.

\subsection{Gather}

The Gather pattern takes a collection and a sequence of indices in the previous collection and produces a collection composed by the elements of the input collection that corresponde to the index on that position. Since only multiple reads can happen on the same element simultaneously, then each element of the index sequence can be processed in parallel. We implemented this pattern resorting to the Map pattern, where the worker function corresponds to reading the element at the given index from the input collection and writing it in the corresponding slot in the sequence.

[Está um bocado mal explicado]

\subsection{Scatter}

\subsection{Pipeline}
The Pipeline pattern represents the sequential application of multiple operators (or stages) at the same element. Due to having multiple operators, they can be applied in parallel at different elements. However, having only one element at each stage can be too slow and thus, we implemented an alternative parallel version of pipeline - pipeline farm, that have multiple elements being processed at each stage in parallel and thus increase the throughtput of the algorithm. This alternative version results from the combination of the Pipeline and Farm parallel patterns.

%However, for the same reasons as reduce, the weight of each operator might be too small compared to the parallel overhead that it's not worth to use the parallel version. Thus, we also developed an alternative version for pipeline - pipeline farm, that consists in group elements in batches, and process it seq [não sei que mais dizer]

\subsection{Farm}
The Farm pattern is very similar to Map with the constraint that the maximum amount of parallel operations is limited to the number of farms (parameter of the pattern). Thus, each job can be distributed evenly through all the farms and then processed sequentially in the respective farm.

\section{Implementation} \label{Implementation}

In this Section, we ...

No map deixámos a separação em batches para o runtime do Cilk, que faz a separação automaticamente. Tentamos alterar os valores default mas obtivemos piores resultados e, visto que não podemos assumir com que tipos de dados estamos a lidar, achamos melhor deixar esta separação para o Cilk.


Na nossa implementação do reduce, de forma a evitar dataraces e a manter os resultados intermédios contigous em memória, resolvemos utilizar dois arrays auxiliares, um para escrita e outro para leitura, que vão sendo alternados a cada iteração do reduce.


\section{Experimental Evaluation} \label{Experimental_Eval}
In this Section we present an experimental evaluation of the implemented parallel algorithms, comparing their performance against their sequential version.

\subsection{Experimental Setting}

To evaluate the performance of our algorithms, we built a tester application that, for each algorithm, runs each of its versions (parallel, sequential and alternative, when there is one) one after the other a parameterizable amount of times, in order to compute the average of their results and thus filter the noise introduced by the ... . For each algorithm we measured its latency for multiple amount of jobs and its latency for a fixed amount of jobs, with variable computation work. In order to count the elapsed time between the start and finish of the algorithm, we resort to a system call [citar] that returns the amount of the process CPU time, and thus not counting the time when the process is interrupted by the OS's process scheduler, giving more accurate results for the latency. The units utilized are microseconds (us). We run the experiments on node9, a computer with 16 cores and .... .

Análise geral, comparando a performance dos vaŕios uns cons os outros. Ex o map é o que aprenseta melhores resultados comparativamente à versão sequencial, bla bla
Podiamos medir a difenreça entre a paralela e a sequencial dividdo e assim tinhamos um valor que ea comparável com os outro salgoritmos
